mashup
======

the mashup repo. Fork this repo. Try to make something that you could imagine using.

## The mashups

By **Friday** have **at least** the following done (~1 hour)

* **Views. (Minimum of three)** Take an index card and draw a page (a "view") of your application. For example, Twitter's views we went over in class were the "login" and the "timeline" view.
* **Models.** Name each of the models and what their attributes are. For example: **User** model, with an ID, Name, Gender, Age, Allergies.
* **System diagram.** Draw one like the one we did in class: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1j8zTw2WCQNX2zceda3d3_uU2d7Ug35gJzVFI03sPUfs/edit?usp=sharing Name your views and models explicitly when you're doing this.

Some of you guys may have very view light apps. If that's the case, you should probably spend some more time on technical stuff.

Also there are prizes for the winner.

## Grading

Winner gets an auto A along with the prize. The winner will be decided on through excellence voting by the class. 

For the rest of you guys, you will be graded on
* 30% for presentation and demonstration
* 40% for functionality
* 30% for difficulty of the application

When you're done, [add your mashup to the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjqGw-pw5UuudFZ2WEN0Qm5UNWJmSkxNSlNtcjFPaWc#gid=0)
